# Stroke Prediction Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective

The goal of this project is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Stroke Prediction Dataset** to understand the data, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and prepare the dataset for future machine learning models. EDA is a crucial step before applying any machine learning model, as it helps us understand the data and its characteristics.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Stroke Prediction Dataset**, available on Kaggle. It contains information about patients, such as demographic details, medical conditions, and lifestyle factors, aiming to predict whether a patient will suffer a stroke.

You can access the dataset from the following Kaggle link:

### Subfolders:

- **data/**: Folder that contains the original dataset CSV file.
- **notebooks/**: Folder for Jupyter Notebooks where the EDA is conducted.
- **images/**: Optional folder for saving images of generated plots.

## Tasks Completed

1. **Dataset Selection**: Chose the Stroke Prediction Dataset from Kaggle for this project.
2. **Project Setup**: Set up the project environment, created the folder structure, and uploaded the dataset to the server.
3. **Initial Data Inspection**: Performed an initial inspection of the dataset to understand its structure, identify important columns, and detect missing values.
4. **Basic Data Cleaning**: Identified missing values and columns that may not be relevant for the analysis.

## Next Steps

1. **Data Distribution Analysis**: Perform visual analysis of the distribution of key features like age, BMI, glucose levels, etc.
2. **Correlations**: Evaluate correlations between features to identify possible relationships.
3. **Advanced Cleaning**: Decide on whether to remove or impute missing values and consider normalizing the data if necessary.
